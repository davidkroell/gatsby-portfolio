  Gatsby's Portfolio starter
</h1>

Creative personal & portfolio template built with Gatsby. Designed so you can write your blog and talk about awesome books you've read.
This page is based on https://github.com/AbdaliDahir/gatsby-portfolio, but I completely re-organized the whole folder structure and content layout.
The design is basically the same but I removed a lot of parts and introduced other section in place.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create own repository**

    Click the button `Use this template` to create your own repository based on this one.

    ```shell
    # clone your repo
    git clone ...
    ```

1.  **Start developing**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-portfolio/
    npm install
    ```

    Start development server
    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._


## 🧐 What's inside?

It's a full-fledged Gatsby SPA. It has already a GitHub Action set up to publish the site on GitHub pages.

> A GitHub Personal Access Token is required for this. See: https://github.com/enriikke/gatsby-gh-pages-action#knobs--handles
